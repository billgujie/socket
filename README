=== EE450 SOCKET PROGRAMMING PROJECT ===

	Full Name: Jie Gu
	Student ID: 7136721374

=== DESCRIPTION ===

In this project, a file server-client model was designed, it consists
	of one directory server who collects information from three File Servers
	record their TCP port and read two txt files that contain all routing
	and resource information.
	
	And two clients who will contact directory server to request a file, the
	directory server will send Server information back, then clients will
	communicate with File Servers through TCP ports
	
=== FILES ===

	directory_server.c			....directory server who coordinates and relay information
	
	file_server1.c				....file server files responsible for register with directory
	file_server2.c						server and communicate with clients
	file_server3.c
	
	client1.c					....client files that request 'doc'
	client2.c
	
	Makefile					....make file that compile all codes and do the cleaning
	
=== HOW TO RUN CODE ===

	1. Copy all *.c files, Makefile and resource.txt/topology.txt into same directory
	2. type "make clean" to clean any previous compiled files
	3. type "make all" to compile all files
	4. Open 6 terminal windows for directory_server, three file_servers, two clients
	5. Run following commands in order (one command per terminal):
			directory_server
			file_server1
			file_server2
			file_server3
			client1
			client2
	6. file_server will automatically terminate, must use Ctrl+C
	
=== MESSAGES EXCHANGED ===

	File Server	=>	Directory Server	...		File_Server# TCP_Port_No
	File Server	<=	Directory Server	...		ACK
	
	Client	=>	Directory Server		...		Client# doc#
	Client	<=	Directory Server		...		File_Server# TCP_Port_No
	
	Client	=>	File Server				...		Client# doc#
	Client	<=	File Server				...		doc#
	
=== UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR ===

	if the resource file format as following (doc1 does not exist):
		
		File_Server1 1 doc2
		File_Server2 1 doc2
		File_Server3 1 doc2
	
	Then an error message will print "ERROR: Requested doc# does not exist on any of the registered servers."
